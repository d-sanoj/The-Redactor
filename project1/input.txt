    I thought all you non-Floridians might like to see the new crop
    of bumper stickers floating around Florida these days ...
    from those who put the "DUH" in "Floriduh"!


    FLORIDA: If you think we can't vote, wait till you see us drive.

    FLORIDA: We count more than you do.

    FLORIDA: If you don't like the way we count then take I-95 and
    visit one of  the other 56 states.

    FLORIDA: We've been Gored by the bull of politics and we're
    Bushed.

    FLORIDA: Relax, Retire, Revote.

    FLORIDA: Where your vote counts and counts and counts.

    FLORIDA: This is what you get for taking Elian away from us!

    FLORIDA: We're number one! Wait! Recount!

    Palm Beach County:  If you're nice, we'll let you vote twice.

    Palm Beach County: We put the "duh" in Florida.

    Sign on I-95 : Florida this way 2 miles , no, that way  5 miles,
    no, wait 10...

    Pro-electorate's choice: Abort the pregnant chads.

    We, the people,  have spoken. Now shut up and listen while the
         lawyers tell us what we said.

    FLORIDA: We can't vote, but you should see us handle 15 bingo
    cards!

In 1978, with George Lucas a millionaire, he began taking his screenplays for Episodes V and VI and turning them into films, as, despite later declarations, he was already developing the idea of a "trilogy of trilogies" of which Star Wars would have been only Episode IV[2]. In early 1978, Lucas began working on Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back. Star Wars was also retitled Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. However, this time Lucas left the Director's Guild, and Irvin Kershner was the new director with Lucas as the producer. Filming began in mid to late 1978 with the snowy planet of Hoth scenes being filmed in Norway. However, during filming, as if a curse, Norway suffered their worst snowstorm in many years. Mark Hamill, who was still recovering from his car accident injuries, filmed in a scene in the snow while the crew stayed in their hotel rooms. After the filming there concluded, the next part of the filming process turned to Elstree Studios.

Since Lucas wanted this movie to be bigger and more spectacular than Star Wars, more sets were made and new characters were introduced, which included the first black Star Wars character, Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, and a 2-foot puppet named Yoda voiced by Frank Oz. It was also the first time that Han Solo and Princess Leia kissed. But the biggest surprise was Darth Vader's revelation to Luke. A few minutes before shooting that scene, Kershner told Hamill that Vader was his father. However, they did not tell David Prowse, the man in the Vader suit, so when they recorded Vader's dialogue with James Earl Jones the line was "No. I am your father" (helpÂ·info) instead of "No, Obi-Wan killed your father." This line would later spark the lightsaber duel in Episode VI and all the prequels.

Many people believed that the sequel would not be as good as Star Wars, but audiences didn't think so. The Empire Strikes Back took in 6.4 million dollars of the weekend of May 21, 1980. It was also considered the darkest Star Wars movie until Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith was released. However, its gross in the U.S. ended at 290 million dollars, making it the lowest-grossing Star Wars movie. California
